/**
 * Compose a [UIView] of class [T] into the UI hierarchy.
 *
 * @param factory The block creating the [T] to be composed.
 * @param modifier The modifier to be applied to the layout.
 * @param update A callback to be invoked every time the state it reads changes.
 * Invoked once initially and then every time the state it reads changes.
 * @param onRelease A callback invoked as a signal that the [T] has exited the
 * composition forever. Use it release resources and stop jobs associated with [T].
 * @param onReset If not null, this callback is invoked when this composable node is
 * reused in the composition instead of being recreated. Use it to reset the state of [T] to
 * some blank state. If null, this composable node can not be reused.
 * @property properties The properties configuring the behavior of [T]. Default value is
 * [UIKitInteropProperties.Default]
 * @property callbacks Callbacks related to events of [T] transitioning to specific states you want
 * to associate some workload with.
